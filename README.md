# FeUdal Networks for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
This repository implements the FuN architecture from Vezhnevets 2017 et al.
It works out of the box with the current parameters for Breakout, and probably
for most other Atari games too.

## MiniGrid Branch
This branch will not work on its own; you will need a modified version of
the gym-minigrid package (i've tweaked it so the agent is placed in center).

It's mostly here so I can rerun some models that have worked.
